PseudoCoding

I want to be able to make a DND character genrator/character sheet
with options to completely randomize the race/class etc.

Feature, if they fill out the name/background, store those and then have the rest populate randomly


random num generator for 5x from a range of 1-20 (generates the stats), then let them allocate where they want the stats to go
from there calculate the mods

Choosing a random class/race etc. could probably call down from API and do a Math.floor(math.random) type command

Single button to save it all

multi page to first decide what name/race/class and stats, second page with that material and then ask if they want skills/spells/equipment 

another page to store all of your characters?
